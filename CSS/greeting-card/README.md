# ðŸŽ‰ Greeting Card (Interactive)

A playful birthday greeting card with smooth hover animations, button-like links, and section reveals â€” all in **HTML + CSS**, no JavaScript.

---

## âœ… Overview
- **Goal:** Practice pseudo-elements (`::before/::after`), transitions & transforms, link state styling, and hash-based navigation with `:target`
- **Tech:** HTML5, CSS3
- **Status:** Completed

---

## âœ¨ Features
- **Clean card layout:** centered `.card` with rounded corners, shadow, and smooth scale-up on hover  
- **Fun heading:** `h1` uses `::before`/`::after` to add party emojis ðŸ¥³  
- **Accessible links:** custom link states â€” hover, active, focus (visible outline), and visited  
- **Section reveal with CSS only:** clicking **Send Card** or **Share on Social Media** jumps to `#send` / `#share` and shows the matching `<section>` via `section:target`  
- **Micro-interactions:** links change color on hover/active; revealed sections skew slightly on hover
