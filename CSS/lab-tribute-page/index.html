        Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815–1852) collaborated with Charles Babbage on the
        Analytical Engine and wrote a visionary set of notes that outlined how machines could process
        symbols, compose music, and go beyond calculation—ideas that anticipated modern computing.

        Her Note G, which included an algorithm to compute Bernoulli numbers, is widely regarded as
        the first published computer program. Lovelace’s perspective on the creative potential of
        computation continues to inspire scientists and engineers.
