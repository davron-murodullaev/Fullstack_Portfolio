# ðŸ§© Unique Sorted Union

This project is a FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithm challenge called **"Implement a Unique Sorted Union"**.  
It demonstrates how to merge multiple arrays and return a new array containing only **unique values**, in the **order they first appear**.

---

## ðŸ§  Objective

- Create a function named `uniteUnique`.
- The function should accept **two or more arrays** as arguments.
- It should return a **new array** that contains all unique values from the given arrays, preserving the order of first occurrence.

Example:
```js
uniteUnique([1, 2, 4], [2, 3, 5]); 
// Output â†’ [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
